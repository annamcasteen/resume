Focused on building high-performance, cross-functional teams to help large enterprises get to
production more quickly and providing high-quality technical solutions to tough problems. I also

local application testing with Docker and Docker Compose and deploying large applications to private
and public clouds such as AWS and Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

  deployment time for a multi-million dollar application into production by several weeks.
* **Global Consumer and Investment Bank**: Re-platformed a legacy Django web application to run in
  Docker and Pivotal Cloud Foundry, reducing deployment time to production by several weeks.

  to reduce deployment time of a major investment portfolio management web service to 10 minutes
  from 22 weeks.

At ThoughtWorks, I was responsible for providing high-quality engineering for large enterprises. My
focus was largely on infrastructure automation and optimization in legacy, on-premise environments.

* **Global credit card issues and credit broker**: Architected infrastructure-as-code pattern for
  website deployments using Terraform and Chef.
* **Large national mortgage underwriting agency**: Delivered self-service environment creation
  pipeline using Puppet, Ruby and vRealize Operations that reduced creation of development
  environments by two weeks.
* **Large statewide dental insurance provider**: Architected a containerized platform for a dental
  claims processing engine with Rancher, Kubernetes, Docker and VMware vSphere.
* Created hiring and recruiting standards for infrastructure and DevOps consultants for ThoughtWorks
  nationwide.

10/15-5/16
: **Namely**, Site Reliability Engineer

* Maintained 99% uptime and improved continuous deployment of Namely Payroll using Ansible, Octopus
  Deploy, Bash, PowerShell and Jenkins.
* Architected an Ansible playbook and Powershell/CloudFormation to migrate Namely's DMZ Active
  Directory domain onto AWS EC2 and, afterwards, to Amazon Enterprise AD.
* Architected a secure bastion host infrastructure for third-party benefit provider access into
  Namely Payroll with Powershell, Ansible and read-only domain controllers.

2/15-10/15
: **Google**, Managed Systems SRE
: _New York, NY_

* Architected, developed and deployed an outage reporting dashboard using Drupal, SQL and Google's
  visualization API that reduced our overdue backlog by over 60%.
* Hardened remote access and arbitrary command execution into our platform by developing a
  Kerberized Powershell endpoint for use with Rundeck, our infrastructure orchestration tool.
* Reduced knowledge silos and improved visibility of our tools throughout Corporate Engineering by
  creating documentation standards and writing several playbooks and runbooks.
* Consulted and vetted vendor designs for integrating enterprise-level third-party software onto
  Google infrastructure using Google best practices.
